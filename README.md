# Shadertoy Backup
This repository serves as a backup for some of my [shadertoy](http://www.shadertoy.com) projects. It serves as a history for personal progress and a point of reference.

The shaders have been ported to a GLSLCanvas friendly syntax, this includes some subtle changes such as renaming of uniforms. Be aware of this when trying to run these shaders in other environments.

## Usage
This is currently only suited to usage with GLSL canvas which can be setup as followed:

- Open VSCode and install [glsl-canvas](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=circledev.glsl-canvas)
- Create a `glsl` file
- Press **F1** and type: **Show glslCanvas**
